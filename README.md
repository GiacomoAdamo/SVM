# SVM

In this project are implemented different optimization methods for training Support Vector
Machines (supervised learning) in order to solve a classification problem that distinguishes between images of handwritten digits from the MNIST database.

## Description

For the SVMs, three different optimization techniques are tested:
 - Full Minimization
 - Decomposition method
 - Most Violating Pair Decomposition

For each method a detailed explanation is provided in the sections below.

In this project is also implemented a multiclass SVM using the "One Against One” procedure (OAO).
